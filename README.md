Combat simulator for RuneScape 3

To use, enter your stats and the enemy's stats in their corresponding boxes, then press "Simulate Combat".

Accuracy, ability damage, auto-attack damage, armor, damage reduction, and max LP for the player can be found on the gear screen.
AADPT can be found by entering your revolution bar into the RSWiki page for revolution bars.
Total LP in healing is the total amount of LP in food and/or potions you have in your inventory.
Check "Using specific weakness?" if you are using a combat style that directly corresponds to a weakness of your enemy (for example, slash style VS abyssal demons.)

All enemy stats can be found by going to the RSWiki page for the enemy you wish to simulate combat against.
"Enemy accuracy stat LVL" is the level of the enemy's stat that determines their accuracy (Attack for melee, Ranged for ranged, Magic for magic)
'Enemy attack speed" is the period between an enemy's attacks in game ticks (usually 4).
